# Welcome to the IFB104 Workshop

This website serves as an additional resource for the STIMulate IFB104 workshops at Queensland University of Technology, offering supplementary materials and content to enhance the learning experience.

If you think you might need more help or have questions outside of the workshop, feel free to visit the STEM hub at Level 2, GP-Library. Session times for Peer-Learning Facilitators for IFB104 can be found here:

## Additional Tips and Resources

### Coding Environment

If you haven't yet, getting another Integrated Development Environment (IDE) than the IDLE that Python comes with. Some recommended IDE's that work great with Python can be found below:

- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - An IDE specifically designed for Python and offers a better UI than IDLE
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - One of the most popular IDE's in the coding world and offers a bunch of extensions

### Commenting

Ideally your code would be readable even without the comments but it is still good practice to comment so someone (or yourself) can immediately tell what's going on in a code block. Below is an example of a code commentary that's concise and gives a clear explanation of what's going on in the code:

``` python
# Function to add two numbers
def add_numbers(x, y):
    # Store the sum in a variable to return
    result = x + y
    
    # Return the result
    return result

# Loop to print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i) 
```

### Online Resources

Luckily for us, there are a bunch of online resources in the world of coding. You can explore sites that can explain coding in a ton of different ways till you get it. Here are some suggested sites:

- [Official Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) - a tad intimidating but useful if you ***really*** want to know the nitty-gritty
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) - offers a comprehensive Python tutorial with examples and a built-in code editor for hands-on practice. The best site to use as a quick reference.
